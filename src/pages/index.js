              I am <strong>Dhiraj Basukala</strong> from Bhaktapur, Nepal. I am a passionate front end developer with a decade of experience in the web industry, earning expertise in HTML (5), CSS (3), Javascript, front end tools and techniques. I started out as a web designer but quickly got inclined to front end development and, seriously, I never looked back. However, I do not mind occasional design stuffs.  Besides work, Iâ€™m a husband and a father and enjoy spending time with friends and family.
